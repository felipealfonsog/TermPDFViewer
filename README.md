### üìÑ Terminal PDF Viewer [(Experimental Project)](#important-experimental-project)* 
##### Approaching a more stable release! Latest version is running smoothly (v.0.0.3.9 >).

TermPDF Viewer is a Python program that enables users to view and navigate PDF files directly within the terminal.

TermPDF Viewer is a command-line utility built in Python that empowers users to effortlessly view and interact with PDF files from their terminal environment. 

"TermPDF Viewer" is an open-source PDF file viewer designed to run in the terminal on Linux and macOS. It enables users to navigate and explore PDF files directly from the command line, providing an interactive and lightweight experience. Powered by the "PyMuPDF" library, this project offers high-quality rendering of PDF pages, allowing users to easily move forward and backward between pages. "TermPDF Viewer" is a versatile and practical tool for those who want to access PDF documents without the need for a heavy graphical viewer, harnessing the powerful and efficient environment of the terminal.

The program offers a menu-driven interface allowing users to scan and list PDF files in a directory, choose a file to view by entering its corresponding number, and then navigate through its pages. Additionally, the program offers convenient options to move forward, go back, or quit the PDF viewing session, ensuring a seamless and efficient document viewing experience directly within the terminal.

<sub>* This is currently an experimental phase where the primary focus is on making the system functional and establishing a practical and logical pathway that aligns with both my vision and the project's goals. It might contain errors, bugs, etc. Many other non-core elements of the project are considered secondary.</sub>
